# Step 3: Blueprints

The careful planning and detailed research that goes into crafting a beautiful and functional home should also go into creating a beautiful and functional website.

## Target Audience
If you're like me and love to entertain guests in your home, then you'll understand it when I say that your website should be designed for your guests as well as it is designed for you.

Your website design should aid you in achieving administrative and/or business objectives while at the same time providing a pleasant experience for the users that will be visiting your site. So think about them and what will bring them back to your website again.

_**Note:** Work in progress. Come back later to see what's been added._
